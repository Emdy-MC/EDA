An attempt at an accessible and easy to use online archive for minecraft farms and contraptions

Hello curious github user, congratulations on finding this God awful mess that is my attempt at making a website to archive Minecraft designs for public reference.
This will be a slow journey and may not even be finished ever since there is so much I have to learn about back end web development to even come close to what I wish
this project will become. Until then I'll see what I can do, maybe get help from others but doing this by myself would give me a sense of accomplishment so I'm hoping 
its possible to do this solo. 

Current name of the site: Emdy's Design Archive (still up for debate)

My goals for this project:
1) An account system for those that wish to publish designs
2) A proper voting system to enchance the relevance of search results
3) A good search function that is as accurate as possible
4) A simple and accessible UI
5) Overall making this the go-to place for sharing your designs.
