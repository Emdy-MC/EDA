                This is a website that aims to provide an easy access to good Minecraft farms and contraptions 
                and allow the user to easily filter through designs without having the search cluttered by copies
                or unrelated content like on other platforms
            </p>
            <h1 class="question">
                Why does it exist?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                Other platforms to share designs like youtube are plagued with ripoffs, false information and unfavourable
                search results for things you would want to build. While archive discords do exist they also face issues with
                organisation, filtering, moderation, accessibility and more. This website aims to be a free and accessible way
                for anyone to both share their creations as well as have them be discovered by the community.
            </p>
            <h1 class="question">
                How do I use it?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                On the homepage of the site you are greeted with multiple selections of designs, they can be new submissions, 
                recommended designs or even randomly selected ones. If you have a particular thing in mind, you can use the
                search function to find it. If you have a design you want to submit you can head over to the submit page and
                follow the instructions there. Submitted designs can be seen on the vote page where the community can approve
                the post with a voting system incase an admin isn't available to do so.

                As of now this site is a passion project by me, Emdy. But contributions and improvements to the website are 
                welcome and you will defintely be credited if you do so.
