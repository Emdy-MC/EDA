                What is this?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                This is a website that aims to provide an easy access to Minecraft farms and contraptions 
                and allow the user to easily filter through designs without having the search cluttered by copies
                or unrelated content like on other platforms.
            </p>
            <h1 class="question">
                Why does it exist?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                Other platforms to share designs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EmdyMC">YouTube</a> are plagued with ripoffs, 
                false information and unfavourable search results for things you would want to build. While archive discords do exist 
                they also face issues with organisation, filtering, moderation, accessibility and more. This website aims to be a free 
                and accessible way for anyone to both share their creations as well as have them be discovered by the community.
            </p>
            <h1 class="question">
                How do I use it?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                On the homepage of the site you are greeted with multiple selections of designs, If you have a particular 
                thing in mind, you can use the search function to find it. If you have a design you want to submit you can head over 
                to the submit page and follow the instructions there. Submitted designs can be voted to show popular favour and help 
                show it to more people easier through search. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="question">
                What about credit?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                If you use a design and make social media content with it be sure to give as much credit as possible to the 
                designer with whatever links you can. Reminder that stealing a design as your own is abusing someone's time and
                effort to benefit you. If you have a conscience and don't want to be exposed as a thief then giving ample credit
                is the least you can do.

            <h1 class="question">
                Who made this?
            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                This site is a passion project by me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EmdyMC">Emdy</a>. I'm making/have made
                it as a challenge and learning experience in coding which is why a lot of the features may seem rough around the
                edges and not well done but it can and will be improved in the near future.
